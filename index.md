### Scene Recognition with Deep CNNs (MIT Indoor67)  
**[🔗 View Source Code](https://github.com/sarayusd/Scene-Recognition-with-Deep-CNNs)**

**1. Dense like Teacher (Strong Backbone)**  
- Implemented a custom DenseNet-like architecture from scratch.  
- Used **SE (Squeeze and Excitation)** in bottleneck blocks to improve channelwise attention.  

**2. Hybrid CNN + SE (Student) with Knowledge Distillation**  
- Built a lighter Hybrid CNN with SE blocks for faster inference.  
- Distilled soft targets from the Dense-like teacher so that the student learned richer class boundaries than from hard labels alone.  

**3. Ensemble Learning**  
- Final predictions were ensembled across all trained models:  
  - Dense-like teacher  
  - Distilled Hybrid CNN + SE  
  - Other experimental CNN variants (Mini / Efficient-style)  
- Achieved a project-high **76% F1-score** and enhanced robustness by combining multiple models using soft and weighted ensemble voting.  

- **Tech:** PyTorch · CNN · SE blocks · Knowledge distillation · Ensemble voting
