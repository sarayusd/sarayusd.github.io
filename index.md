# Sustainable Energy Management in Smart Homes with Reinforcement Learning  
**[ðŸ”— View Source Code]( https://github.com/sarayusd/Sustainable-Energy-Management-with-Reinforcement-Learning.git)**

This project explores intelligent **battery storage control** in a **single building** energy system using the [CityLearn](https://www.citylearn.net/) simulation environment.  
The goal is to minimize energy cost, reduce carbon emissions, and flatten peak loads through learning-based control strategies, comparing traditional **Rule Based Control** with advanced RL algorithms **PPO** and **SAC**.

We compare:
- **Rule Based Control (RBC)** baseline strategy  
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** (on-policy)  
- **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** (off-policy with entropy regularization)

---

##  Problem Overview
- Urban buildings create peak loads during expensive and carbon intensive periods.
- A battery can charge during off-peak/solar hours and discharge during peak hours to flatten the load curve.
- We train RL agents to learn this control policy automatically.

---

## ðŸ§ª Simulation Setup
- **Environment:** CityLearn 2022 dataset  
- **Scenario:** Single building, centralized control  
- **Simulation Window:** 7 days  
- **Key Observations:** hour, net consumption, price, carbon intensity, solar generation, SoC  
- **Action:** continuous in [-1, 1]  
  - `-1` = discharge  
  - `0` = idle  
  - `1` = charge

---

##  Reward Design
The reward combines:
- Energy penalty  
- Electricity cost  
- Carbon penalty  
- Peak demand penalty  

It incentivizes:
- Charging during solar/off-peak periods   
- Discharging during high-price and high-carbon hours 
- Avoiding demand spikes.

#  Scene Recognition with Deep CNNs (MIT Indoor67)  
**[ðŸ”— View Source Code]( https://github.com/sarayusd/Scene-Recognition-with-Deep-CNNs.git)**

This project focuses on **indoor scene classification** using the MIT Indoor67 dataset.  
Indoor scene recognition is challenging due to high intra-class variability, clutter, and reliance on object-level cues rather than global layouts.  
We implement and compare multiple deep learning architectures and combine them using **ensemble learning** to improve accuracy and robustness.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset Description

- **Dataset:** [MIT Indoor67](http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/indoor.html)  
- **Classes:** 67 indoor categories (e.g., bookstore, kitchen, auditorium)  
- **Images:** 15,620 total  
- **Split:** standard train/val/test  
- **Input:** 224Ã—224 RGB images  
- **Metrics:** Top-1 accuracy, macro/weighted F1, confusion matrix

### Preprocessing
- Train: random crops, flips, rotations, color jitter, normalization  
- Val/Test: resize + normalization

### Class Imbalance Handling
- Used class weights, label smoothing, weighted sampling, and targeted fine-tuning.

### 3. Ensemble (Soft & Weighted Voting)

| Model                 | Acc | Macro F1 | Weighted F1 |
|-----------------------|-----|----------|-------------|
| DenseNet (Teacher)    | 62% | 0.60     | 0.62        |
