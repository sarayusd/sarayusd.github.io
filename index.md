# Scene Recognition with Deep CNNs (MIT Indoor67)
**[🔗 View Source Code](https://github.com/sarayusd/Scene-Recognition-with-Deep-CNNs)**

 **1. Dense like Teacher (Strong Backbone)**
- Implemented a custom DenseNet-like architecture from the scratch.
- Achieved strong single-model performance on indoor 67 dataset.
- Used SE (Squeeze and Excitation)* in bottleneck blocks to improve channelwise attention.

 **2. Hybrid CNN + SE (Student) with Knowledge Distillation**
- Built a lighter Hybrid CNN with SE blocks for faster inference.
- Distilled soft targets from the Dense like teacher so that student learned richer class boundaries than from hard labels alone.

 **3. Ensemble Learning**
- Final predictions were ensembled across all trained models:
  - Dense like teacher
  - Distilled Hybrid CNN + SE
  - Other experimental CNN variants (Mini / Efficient-style)
- Achieved a project high 76% F1-score and enhanced robustness by combining multiple models using soft and weighted ensemble voting.
 **Tech:** PyTorch, CNN , SE blocks, knowledge distillation, ensemble voting
